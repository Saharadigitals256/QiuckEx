## Backend

Install dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

Run migrations.

```bash
pnpm run db:verify-migrations
```

Verify migrations forward and rollback:
```bash
pnpm run db:verify-migrations
```

Run mutation testing for financial authorization:
```bash
pnpm run test:mutation
```

Run Horizon performance regression tests:
```bash
pnpm run test:perf:horizon
```

Run cross-package generated type checks:
```bash
pnpm run check:generated-types
```

Start development.

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Rust Contracts

Compile contracts.

```bash
cargo build
```

Execute tests.

```bash
cargo test
```

Lint.

```bash
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features
```

Format.

```bash
cargo fmt
```

## Before Opening a Pull Request

Verify that:

- The project builds successfully.
- Database migrations are up to date.
- Rust tests pass (`cargo test`).
- TypeScript tests pass (`npm test`).
- Linting and secret scanning pass (`./scripts/secret-scan.sh --verify`).
- The governance gate passes (`node scripts/governance/check.mjs`) if you touched a policy or ADR.
- The local fixtures still match the schema (`node scripts/local-dev/check-seed.mjs`) if you changed `scripts/local-dev/seed.sql` or any migration.
- Relevant capability maps and contract maps are updated in the same PR.
- Record assumptions about network, custody, and backward compatibility in the PR description.

## Running the backend locally

`scripts/local-dev/bootstrap.sh` brings up a local Supabase and Redis and seeds
deterministic fixtures, so you can work against real services instead of mocks:

```bash
./scripts/local-dev/bootstrap.sh
```

It reports every missing prerequisite in one pass, waits for Postgres, applies the
migrations, seeds idempotent fixtures, and prints the values to export. Redis is
optional — the backend falls back to in-memory caching when `REDIS_URL` is unset.
The fixtures are synthetic and contain **public keys only**; no signing material is
ever stored, consistent with self-custody (ADR 0001). Full details and
troubleshooting: [../scripts/local-dev/README.md](../scripts/local-dev/README.md).
